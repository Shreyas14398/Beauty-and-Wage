Research Question: Does the looks of a person have any significant impact on wage?

Data Source: ‘beauty’ in the Wooldridge package.

Applied the knowledge gained in this class using multiple linear regression with the OLS estimation technique to identify significant parameters in predicting employee wages. Ran regression models with wage and log(wage) as dependent variables, incorporating selected independent variables and their interaction effects. Following the regressions, hypothesis testing to study the joint significance between the variables and computed R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to pinpoint and interpret the coefficients of the significant variables.
